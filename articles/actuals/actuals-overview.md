# Actuals 

_**Applies to:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Actuals represent the reviewed and approved financial and schedule progress on a project. They are created as a result of approval of time, expense, material usage entries, and journal entries and invoices. 
> Note
> Actuals should not be edited or deleted from the system as this could tamper the financial integrity and any integration with other financial and accounting sytems. Project Operations provides for corrections of actuals by creating reversing and replacing actuals at various points in the business process lifecycle of your projects. 


## Record actuals based on project events

Project Operations records the financial transactions that occur during a project. These transactions are recorded as actuals. The following tables show the different types of actuals that are created, depending on whether the project is a time-and-materials or fixed-price project, is in the presales stage, or is an internal project.



### Actuals on a Fixed price Billing arrangement

### Actuals on a Pre-Sales stage Project

### Actuals on an Internal Project (no customer billings)
