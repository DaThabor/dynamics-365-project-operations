# Use Schedule APIs to perfom create, update and delete operations with Scheduling entities (Public Preview)

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_
  
## Scheduling entities

Schedule APIs provide ability to perform create, update and delete operations with **Scheduling entities**. These entities are managed through the Scheduling engine in Project for the Web (P4W). Create, update and delete operations with Scheduling entities were restricted in earlier Project Operations releases.

Full list of Scheduling entities provided below:

| **Entity Name ** | **Entity Logical Name** |
| --- | --- |
| Project | msdyn\_project |
| Project Task  | msdyn\_projecttask  |
| Project Task Dependency  | msdyn\_projecttaskdependency  |
| Resource Assignment | msdyn\_resourceassignment |
| Project Bucket  | msdyn\_projectbucket |
| Project Team Member | msdyn\_projectteam |

## OperationSet

OperationSet is a unit-of-work pattern that can be used when several schedule impacting requests are required to be processed within a transaction.

## Schedule APIs

**msdyn_CreateProjectV1** â€“ this API can be used to create a Project. The project and default Project Bucket is created immediately.

**msdyn_CreateTeamMemberV1** - This API can be used to create Project Team Member. The records are created immediately.

**msdyn_CreateOperationSetV1** - This API can be used to to schedule several requests that need to be performed within a transaction.

**msdyn_PSSCreateV1** - This API can be used to create an entity. This entity can be any of the Scheduling entities supporting create operation.

**msdyn_PSSUpdateV1** - This API can be used to update an entity. This entity can be any of the Scheduling entities supporting update operation.

**msdyn_PSSDeleteV1** - This API can be used to delete an entity. This entity can be any of the Scheduling entities supporting delete operation.

**msdyn_ExecuteOperationSetV1** - This API is used to execute all the operations within the given operation set. 


## Using Schedule APIs with OperationSet

As records with both CreateProjectV1 and CreateTeamMemberV1 are created immediately, these APIs cannot be used in the OperationSet directly. However, you can use API to create needed records, then create an OperationSet and use these pre-created records in the OperationSet.

## Supported Operations

| Scheduling entity | Create | Update | Delete | Important considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
Project task | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Project task dependency | Yes | Yes | | Project task dependency records are not updated, instead old record can be deleted and new record can be created. |
| Resource assignment | Yes | Yes | | Operations with the following fields are not supported: BookableResourceID, Effort, EffortCompleted, EffortRemaining, PlannedWork. Resource assignment records are not updated, instead old record can be deleted and new record can be created. |
| Project bucket | | | | Default bucket is created using CreateProjectV1 API |
| Project team member | Yes | Yes | Yes | For create operation use API CreateTeamMemberV1 |
| Project | Yes | Yes | | Operations with the following fields are not supported: StateCode, BulkGenerationStatus, GlobalRevisionToken, CalendarID, Effort, EffortCompleted, EffortRemaining, Progress, Finish, TaskEarliestStart, Duration |

These APIs can be called with entity objects that include custom fields.

The Id property is optional, if it is provided, system will attempt to use it and will throw an exception if it cannot be used. If it is not provided, system will generate it.

## Limitations and known issues

- Schedule APIs can only be used by **Users with Microsoft Project License.** They cannot be used by Application Users, System Users, Integration Users, and other Users that do not have the required license.
- Each OperationSet can only have a max of 100 operations.
- Each user can only have a max of 10 open OperationSets.
- Project Operations currently supports a max of 500 total tasks on a project.
- OperationSet failure status and failure logs are not currently available.
- **Schedule APIs are in Public preview, using these APIs in Production is not supported by Microsoft.**

## Sample scenario

In this scenario we will create a Project, a Team Member, 4 Tasks and 2 Resource Assignments. Then we will update 1 Task, update the Project, delete 1 Task, delete 1 Resource Assignment and create a Task Dependency.

////Sample code snippet

Entity project = CreateProject();

project.Id = CallCreateProjectAction(project);

var projectReference = project.ToEntityReference();

var teamMember = new Entity(&quot;msdyn\_projectteam&quot;, Guid.NewGuid());

teamMember[&quot;msdyn\_name&quot;] = $&quot;TM {DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()}&quot;;

teamMember[&quot;msdyn\_project&quot;] = projectReference;

var createTeamMemberResponse = CallCreateTeamMemberAction(teamMember);

var description = $&quot;My demo {DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()}&quot;;

var operationSetId = CallCreateOperationSetAction(project.Id, description);

var task1 = GetTask(&quot;1WW&quot;, projectReference);

var task2 = GetTask(&quot;2XX&quot;, projectReference, task1.ToEntityReference());

var task3 = GetTask(&quot;3YY&quot;, projectReference);

var task4 = GetTask(&quot;4ZZ&quot;, projectReference);

var assignment1 = GetResourceAssignment(&quot;R1&quot;, teamMember, task2, project);

var assignment2 = GetResourceAssignment(&quot;R2&quot;, teamMember, task3, project);

var task1Response = CallPssCreateAction(task1, operationSetId);

var task2Response = CallPssCreateAction(task2, operationSetId);

var task3Response = CallPssCreateAction(task3, operationSetId);

var task4Response = CallPssCreateAction(task4, operationSetId);

varassignment1Response = CallPssCreateAction(assignment1, operationSetId);

varassignment2Response = CallPssCreateAction(assignment2, operationSetId);

task2[&quot;msdyn\_subject&quot;] = &quot;Updated Task&quot;;

var task2UpdateResponse = CallPssUpdateAction(task2, operationSetId);

project[&quot;msdyn\_subject&quot;] = $&quot;Proj update {DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString()}&quot;;

var projectUpdateResponse = CallPssUpdateAction(project, operationSetId);

var task4DeleteResponse = CallPssDeleteAction(task4.Id.ToString(), task4.LogicalName, operationSetId);

varassignment2DeleteResponse = CallPssDeleteAction(assignment2.Id.ToString(), assignment2.LogicalName, operationSetId);

var dependency1 = GetTaskDependency(project, task2, task3);

var dependency1Response = CallPssCreateAction(dependency1, operationSetId);

CallExecuteOperationSetAction(operationSetId);

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Done....&quot;);
