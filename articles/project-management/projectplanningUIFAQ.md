# Privileges for Project for the Web

## Description

Project Operations relies upon an external scheduling service with an application user that requires several roles to read and write to entities related to the work breakdown structure; including but not limited to **project task** s, **resource assignments** and **task dependencies**. If a user is unable to render the work breakdown structure when they navigate to the task tab is likely the issues stems from Project for Project Operations has not been enabled for the user.

1. Verify that the user has been assigned the correct license and that the service is enabled in the service plans details of the license
2. Verify that the user can open project.microsoft.com
3. Verify that the system is pointing to the correct project endpoint, via project parameters
4. Verify that the Project Application user is created as above.
5. Apply the following security roles to the user:

  1. Common data service user or Base user
  2. Project Operations System
  3. Project System
