# Project management overview

The project management tools in Dynamics 365 Project Operations help you easily run projects. The scheduling tools help project managers and teams stay productive. Here are some of the tasks that the tools help with:

- Plan projects by using a work schedule and estimates.
- Estimate and track project costs and revenue.
- Use project estimates during the sales process.
- Forecast resource requirements for projects that are in the pipeline.
- Successfully deliver projects by tracking progress and cost consumption.

The following topics provide information that will help project managers estimate work, estimate project costs, and forecast resource requirements by using the tools that are supported in PSA:

- [Creating a schedule](project-creating.md)
- [Estimating project cost and revenue](project-estimating.md)
- [Leveraging the schedule and estimates](project-leveraging.md)
- [Tracking project progress and cost consumption](project-tracking.md)
- [Project stages](project-stages.md)
- [Project settings](project-settings.md)
