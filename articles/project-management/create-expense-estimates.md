# Expense estimates
_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Along with defining resource-based estimates, Dynamics 365 Project Operations allows Project managers to define project-based expenses for each project. Each expense item can be associated with a specific project task or expense category. Expense categories are typically defined at the organizational level. Pricing for each expense category is typically defined in the following hierarchy:

- Organization
- Customer
- Quote/contract

Complete the following steps to view, add, or delete a project expense.

1. Go to **Projects**, and select the project you want to work on.
2. Select the **Project Estimates** tab and view the list of project expenses.
3. Select **New Expense** to add an expense. Or, select an expense to delete, and then select **Delete Expense**.

The following attributes are defined for each expense line item:

- **Category**: The common groupings used to describe all expenses incurred on a project.
- **Start Date**: The date when the expense is forecasted to be incurred.
- **Quantity**: The estimated number of expense items for a specific category.
- **Unit Cost Price**: The unit price used to calculate to cost of the expense.
- **Unit Sales Price**: The unit price used to calculate the sale prices of the expense.
