# Collaboration with Office Groups

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

Office Groups allow you to share a project with other team members in the Common Data Service. When you add users to the group, the ownership of the project will change to the group. All users will have edit permission on the project. Users may also see the project if privlideges have been granted by the administrator. These users will not be displayed in the group.

> [!NOTE] 
> Users are only added to the group if you press **Groups** and add them. This is different to the behaviour of Project for the Web.
