# Collaboration with Office Groups
Office Groups allow you to share a project with other team members within Common Data Service. When adding users to the group, the ownership of the project will change from the user to the group. All users will have edit permission on the project. Users may also see the project if privlideges have been granted by the administrator, these users will not be displayed inthe group.

>![NOTE] Users are only added to the group if you press **Groups** and add them. This is different to the behaviour of Project for the Web. 

For more information see documentation on the [security model](../environment/securitymode.md) in Project Operations.
