## Project Operations dual-write maps updates

No updates for Project Operations Dual Write maps in this release. Please refer to [Project Operations dual-write map versions | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/project-operations/environment/resource-dual-write-maps) for current list and versions of Project Operations Dual Write maps.

You should always run the latest version of the map in your environment and enable all related table maps as you update your Project Operations Dataverse solution and Finance and Operations solution version. Certain features and capabilities might not work correctly if the latest version of the map is not activated. You can see the active version of the map in the  **Version**  column on the  **Dual-write**  page. You can activate a new version of the map by selecting  **Table map versions** , selecting the latest version, and then saving the selected version. If you have customized an out-of-the-box table map, reapply the changes. For more information, see [Application lifecycle management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management).

If you encounter an issue with starting the map, follow instructions in the [Missing table columns issue on maps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-troubleshooting-finops-upgrades#missing-table-columns-issue-on-maps) section of the Dual Write troubleshooting guide.
