# Personal Expenses on Expense Report
During business travel, workers might sometimes charge personal expenses to their corporate credit cards. If you don't define a process for handling personal expenses, the approval process for expense reports might be disrupted when workers submit their itemized expense reports.

There are two methods for handling a worker's personal expenses:

Paid by employee – Your organization doesn't pay personal expenses that appear on the bill for the corporate credit card. The employee needs to pay the credit card vendor directly for such expenses. 

Paid by company – Your organization pays the whole bill for the corporate credit card and then debits the worker's account for the personal expenses.

You can select the method that your organization uses on the Expense management parameters page.
