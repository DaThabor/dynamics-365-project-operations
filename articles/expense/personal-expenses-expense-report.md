# Work with personal expenses on an expense report

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

During business travel, an employee might charge personal expenses to their corporate credit card. If a process hasn't been defined for handling personal expenses, the expense report approval process might be disrupted when an employee submits their itemized expense report.

There are two methods you can use to work with an employee's personal expenses:

  - **Paid by employee**: Your organization doesn't pay personal expenses that appear on the bill for the corporate credit card. Instead, the employee pays the credit card vendor directly for the expenses. 
  - **Paid by company**: Your organization pays the full bill for the corporate credit card, and then debits the worker's account for the personal expenses.

You can select the method that your organization uses on the **Expense management parameters** page.


# Enable split expense function when personal amount field has value defined

This feature only applies to expense reports approved using line level workflow and approved from Process expense reports > Expense reports assign to me > Open expense report. 

When this feature is enabled,  expense lines using the split to personal amount will generate 2 lines upon expense report submit, so that the approver can approve each line separately.

To enable this feature, go to workspaces--> Feature Management--> select "Enable split expense function when personal amount field has value defined" and click "enable now".
