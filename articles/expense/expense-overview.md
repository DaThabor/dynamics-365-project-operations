_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_


Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations supports the ability to process expenses. Expense processing can occur with or without projects by using a customizable workflow of policies, transaction categories, and approvals.

In Project Operations, there are two supported deployment models for Expense: 

- **Full** - The full deployment is available for **Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios** or **Project Operations for production order based scenarios**.
- **Basic** - The basic deployment is available for **Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios** and **Lite deployment â€“ deal to proforma invoicing**.

## Full 
The Full Expense deployment includes a complete policy enforcement, which includes the ability to create policies, such as expense category limits, travel, per diem, credit card imports, and receipt optical character recognition.

## Basic 
The Basic Expense deployment scenario allows you to only record basic expenses against a project. 

For more information, see [Expense entry (lite)](basic-expense.md)

## Determine your Expense deployment
Basic Expense is located next to the Project management and accounting functionality. To determine if you are running the Basic Expense management deployment, verify that the address URL ends with **.crm.dynamics.com**.
