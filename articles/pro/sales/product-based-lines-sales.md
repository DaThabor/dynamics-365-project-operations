# Product-based opportunity lines

Product – based opportunity lines are line items on the opportunity that are delivered to the customer as distinct line items on the eventual invoice without any other value-added services on them. The associated spend and consumption is not tracked on tasks of any projects related to that engagement.

Product – based lines can be catalog items or write-in products. Most of the functionality on product – based lines on the opportunity follows the functionality provided by the Dynamics 365 Sales application.

To find more information about product-based opportunity lines, please refer to the help documentation in the Sales application here:

One concept in product-based opportunity lines that is specific to Project-based opportunities is Customer budget. Use this field to type in an amount that the customer is willing to pay for line item.

Customer budget values across product and project-based are summarized to calculate the estimated revenue of the project-based opportunity if the &quot;revenue method&quot; in the opportunity summary is set to &quot;system calculated&quot;.
