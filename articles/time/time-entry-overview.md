# Time overview
Time Entry is the process of recording actual time that is consumed by a resource. Time entries in Dynamics 365 Project Operations allow for the progression of tasks and the calculation of cost and sales prices. These entries help the Project manager keep on top of projects and tasks. Time entries also notify Resource managers of any potential vacation or absences which appears on the schedule board as **Out** allowing them to plan accordingly.

When recording time in Project Operations, users can track against any level in the project. This includes the task, summary, or project level.

Project team memebers create and submit time entries for approval and the Project Approvers approve the entries. The project team member might recall a time entry for corrections.

For information about how to create a time entry, submit or recall an entry, and other tools to help complete your reporting, see [Time Entry User Interface](ui-behavior-time.md).


## Extentions and customization
The underlying deisgn of time entry allows for additional field and customization to meet customers needs. For more developer information, see [extending time entries](extending-time-entries.md)
