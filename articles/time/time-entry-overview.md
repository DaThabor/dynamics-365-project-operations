# Time Overview
Time Entry is the process of recording actual time consumed by a resource. Time entries in Project Operations allow for the progression of tasks and the calculation of cost and sales prices of the action. This allows the Project Manager to keep on top of the projects and tasks. Time entries also allow for the notice to resource managers of any potential vacation or absentee which appears on the scheduleboard as out. This allows the resource manager to plan accordingly.

When recording time in Project Operations, users are able to track against any level in the project. At the task, summary or project level.

Project Team Memebers create time entries, submit them for approval where the Project Approvers apprve the entry. The Project Team member may recall a time entry for corrections.

For more information see
 - [Time Entry User Interface](ui-behavior-time.md) which includes information around how to create a time entry, submit or recall and entry and other tools to help complete your reporting.


## Extentions and customization
As the underlying deisgn of time entry allows for additional field and customization to meet customers needs, developers should review [extending time entries](extending-time-entries.md)
