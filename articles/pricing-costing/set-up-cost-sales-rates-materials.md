# Set up cost and sales rates for materials

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

You can set up cost and sales prices for products in Dynamics 365 Project Operations. Cost and sales prices for products can only be listed in one currency, which must be the currency on the price list header.

To set up cost and sales rates for products, complete the following steps. 

1. Go to **Sales** > **Customers** > **Price Lists** and select **New** to create a new price list. 
2. On the **Price list items**, on the subgrid menu, select **New price list item**. 
3. On the **Quick Create** page, enter the product and unit that you are creating the new price for.

For more information about how to define prices for catalog items, see [Setup pricing for products](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/create-price-lists-price-list-items-define-pricing-products) and [Decimal precision in currency and pricing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/sales-enterprise/decimal-precision-currency-pricing).
