# Navigate Project Operations

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

Dynamics 365 Project Operations for resource/non-stocked scenarios consists of two components: 

 - **Project Operations on Common Data Service (CDS) environment**: This component covers capabilities and processes from opportunity to proforma invoicing. 
 - **Project management and accounting on Dynamics 365 Finance environment**: This component covers expense management capabilities, project accounting, and revenue recognition. 

After you provision Project Operations as described in this topic, the Lifecycle Servies (LCS) **Environment details** page provides easy access to both components of Project Operations.  

Use the environment name in the section, **Common Data Service Environment Name** to navigate to Project Operations on a CDS environment. 
Use Login > Log on to Dynamics 365 F&O environment button to navigate to Project management and accounting module.
