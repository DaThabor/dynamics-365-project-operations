## <a name="new"></a>Install Project Operations to a new Dataverse environment

1. As the [Global or Power Platform Administrator](/power-platform/admin/global-service-administrators-can-administer-without-license) with a Project Operations license, create a new Dataverse environment in the [PowerPlatform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.com). Make sure that **Create a database for this environment** and **Dynamics 365 Apps** are enabled. For more information, see [Create and manage environments in the Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/create-environment#create-an-environment-in-the-power-platform-admin-center).
2. Select **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Operations** from the deployment list of Dynamics 365 apps.


## <a name="existing"></a>Install Project Operations to an existing Dataverse environment
1. Ensure that the environment has not been configured with [dual-write](../dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/dual-write-overview) as installation will then install the [Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios](project-operations-integrated-deployment-overview.md) capabilties.
2. As the [Global or Power Platform Administrator](/power-platform/admin/global-service-administrators-can-administer-without-license) with a Project Operations license, locate the environment in the [PowerPlatform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.com) where you want to install Project Operations.
