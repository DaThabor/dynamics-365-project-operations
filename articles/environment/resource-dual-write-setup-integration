# Project Operations setup and configuration data integration

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

This topic provides information about setup and configuration related Project Operations Dual Write maps:

  - Project contract, contract lines and projects
  - Billing milestones
  - Project tasks
  - Project resources
  - Transaction categories

## Project contract, contract lines and projects

Project contract, contract lines and projects are created in Dataverse and synchronize to Finance and Operations apps for further accounting purposes. Records in these entities can be created and deleted in Dataverse only, however accounting attributes, such as sales tax group defaults and financial dimensions can be added to these records in Finance and Operations apps.

Sales activity – leads, opportunities and quotes are tracked in Dataverse and do not synchronize to Finance and Operations apps as there is no downstream accounting associated with this activity.

Project contract in Dataverse creates Project contract record in Finance and Operations apps using **Project contract headers (salesorders)** table map. Saving Project contract in Dataverse also triggers creating Project contract customer entity record. This record gets synchronized to Finance and Operations apps using **Project funding source (msdyn\_projectcontractssplitbillingrules)** table map. This map also synchronizes further project contract customer additions, updates and deletions. Split billing percentages between project contract customers are mastered in Dataverse only and not synchronized to Finance and Operations apps.

Once project contract is created in Dataverse, project accountant can update accounting attributes for this project contract in Finance and Operations apps by opening Project management and accounting \&gt; Project contracts \&gt; Set up \&gt; Show default accounting. Accountant can review operational project contract attributes (such as requested delivery date, contract amount, etc.) by selecting Project contract ID in Finance and Operations apps which will open related project contract record in Dataverse.

Project entity is synchronized to Finance and Operations apps using **Projects V2 (msdyn\_projects)** table map. Accountant can review projects in Finance and Operations apps by opening Project management and accounting \&gt; All projects. Project accountant can update accounting attributes for the project in Finance and Operations apps by opening Project management and accounting \&gt; All projects \&gt; Set up \&gt; Show default accounting. Accountant can review operational project attributes (such as estimated start and end dates, etc.) by selecting Project ID in Finance and Operations apps which will open related project record in Dataverse.

Project gets associated with Project contract through Project contract line entity.

Project contract lines in Dataverse creates Project contract billing rule in Finance and Operations apps using **Project contract lines (salesorderdetails)** table map. Billing method defines project contract billing rule type in Finance and Operations apps:

- Project contract lines with Time and material billing method creates a billing rule of time and material type.
- Fixed price billing method contract line creates milestone billing rule.

Project contract lines can be reviewed by project accountant in Finance and Operations apps by opening Project management and accounting \&gt; Project contracts \&gt; Set up \&gt; Show default accounting and reviewing the details in Contract lines tab. Accountant can also set default financial dimensions for Fixed price billing method contract lines in this tab.

## Billing milestones

Project contract lines using Fixed price billing method are invoiced through billing milestones. Billing milestones are synchronized to Finance and Operations apps Project on-account transactions using **Project Operations integration contract line milestones (msdyn\_contractlinescheduleofvalues)** table map.

Accountant can review On-account transactions and adjust accounting attributes for those transactions in Project management and accounting \&gt; Project contracts \&gt; Maintain \&gt; On-account transactions or Project management and accounting \&gt; All projects\&gt; Maintain \&gt; On-account transactions.

When user creates first billing milestone for a given project contract line, system automatically creates Fixed price revenue estimate project for the project associated with this contract line. Fixed-price revenue estimate projects can be reviewed in Project management and accounting \&gt; Fixed-price revenue estimate projects.

#### Project tasks

Project tasks are synchronized to Finance and Operations apps through **Project tasks (msdyn\_projecttasks)** table map for reference purposes only. Task creation, update and delete operations are not supported through Finance and Operations apps.

## Project resources

Project resource roles entity is synchronized to Finance and Operations apps using **Project resource roles for all companies (bookableresourcecategories)** table map for reference purposes only. As resource roles in Dataverse are not company – specific, system automatically creates respective company specific resource roles records in Finance and Operations apps automatically for all legal entities included into Dual write integration scope.

![Resource roles integration](./media/5Resources.jpg)

Project resources in Project Operations are maintained in Dataverse and are not synchronized to Finance and Operations apps.

#### Transaction categories

Transaction categories are maintained in Dataverse and synchronized to Finance and Operations apps using **Project transaction categories (msdyn\_transactioncategories)** table map. Once transaction category record is synchronized, system automatically creates four Shared category records (one per each transaction type: time, expense, item and fee) in Finance and Operations apps and links them to the Transaction category record.

![Transaction categories integration](./media/4TransactionCategories.jpg)

Using transaction categories for estimates and actuals require Project Accountant or System Administrator to create corresponding Project categories in every Legal entity, as described in [Configure project categories | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/project-operations/project-accounting/configure-project-categories).
