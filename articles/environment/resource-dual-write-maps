# Project Operations Dual write map versions

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

Using Project Operations for Resource/ non-stocked scenarios requires a set of Dual Write maps to be running at the environment. This article provides the list of Dual write maps required for Project Operations.

###

### Prerequisite maps (Dual Write Orchestration solution)

The following maps are mandatory prerequisites for Project Operations solution. Make sure to run the maps below and all related to it table maps in your environment.

| Table map | Initial sync |
| --- | --- |
| Ledger (msdyn_ledgers)
 | Requires initial sync for the table map and all prerequisites. Master for initial sync is Finance and Operations apps |
| Legal entities (cdm_companies)
 | Not required. System populates this entity automatically when environments are linked using Dual Write. |
| Customers V3 (accounts)
 | Not required for provisioning |
| Vendors V2 (msdyn_vendors)
 | Not required for provisioning |

1. From the list of maps, select the Ledger **(msdyn\_ledgers)** map with all prerequisites and select the **Initial sync** check box. In the **Master for initial sync** field, select **Finance and Operations apps** for both ledger map and all prerequisite maps and then select **Run**.

1. Use the same steps for remaining table maps in the steps above, however do not select Initial sync flag when running those maps.

## Project Operations Dual Write maps

The following maps are required for Project Operations solution.

| **Entity Map** | **Latest version** | **Initial sync** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integration entity for project transaction relationships (msdyn\_transactionconnections) | 1.0.0.0 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project contract headers (sales orders) | 1.0.0.1 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project contract lines (salesorderdetails) | 1.0.0.0 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project funding source (msdyn_projectcontractsplitbillingrules) | 1.0.0.1 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration table for material estimates (msdyn\_estimatelines) | 1.0.0.0 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project invoice proposals V2 (invoices) | 1.0.0.2 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration actuals (msdyn_actuals) | 1.0.0.14 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration contract line milestones (msdyn_contractlinesscheduleofvalues) | 1.0.0.4 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration entity for expense estimates (msdyn_estimateslines) | 1.0.0.2 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration entity for hour estimates (msdyn_resourceassignments) | 1.0.0.5 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration project expense categories export entity (msdyn_expensecategories) | 1.0.0.2 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration project expenses export entity (msdyn_expenses) | 1.0.0.2 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration project vendor invoice export entity (msdyn_projectvendorinvoices) | 1.0.0.0 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project Operations integration project vendor invoice line export entity (msdyn_projectvendorinvoicelines) | 1.0.0.0 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project resource roles for all companies (bookableresourcecategories) | 1.0.0.1 | Requires initial sync for the table map, to synchronize Project Manager and Team member resource roles that are populated in Dataverse environment during provisioning. Master for initial sync is Dataverse (Common Data Service) |
| Project tasks (msdyn_projecttasks) | 1.0.0.4 | Not required for provisioning |
| Project transaction categories (msdyn_transactioncategories) | 1.0.0.0 | Not required for provisioning |
| Projects V2 (msdyn_projects) | 1.0.0.1 | Not required for provisioning |

Follow these steps to run the maps listed in this section:

1. Enable Project resource roles for all companies (bookableresourcecategories) table map, as this map requires initial sync. Set Master for initial sync to Common data service. Wait until this step is complete.

Wait until map status is **Running** before proceeding with the next step.

2. Select all remaining required maps. You can filter them in Dual Write map list using **Project** keyword in the search at the top right corner, multi-select all maps and run as described in this article: [Manage multiple table maps - Finance &amp; Operations | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/multiple-entity-maps). Make sure to enable and run related entity maps as well.

### Project Operations Dual Write map versions

We advise always run the latest version of the map in your environment. Certain features/ capabilities might not work correctly if:

- map is not activated or
- the latest version of the map is not activated or
- related table maps are not activated

You can see the active version of the map in the **Version** column on the **Dual Write** page. You can activate a new version of the map by selecting **Table map versions** button, selecting the latest version, and then saving the selected version. If you have customized out of the box table map, you will also need reapply the changes following the [Application lifecycle management - Finance &amp; Operations | Dynamics 365 | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/app-lifecycle-management)
