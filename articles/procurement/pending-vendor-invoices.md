# Purchase non-stocked materials using a pending vendor invoice

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

As a company procures non-stocked materials for a project, the costs can be immediately recorded against the project. 

For example, Contoso Robotics US is performing an equipment renewal project and needs software licenses. These licenses are procured from a third-party vendor.  Using Dynamics 365 Finance, the Accounts payable clerk records a pending vendor invoice document and attributes the license costs directly against the equipment renewal project. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you use the functionality described in this topic, review and apply the required configurations. For more information, see [Enable non-stocked materials and pending vendor invoices](configure-materials-nonstocked.md). 

## Post a project-related pending vendor invoice 

Pending vendor invoices can be recorded on the **Pending vendor invoices** page (**Accounts payable** > **Invoices** > **Pending vendor invoices**). Complete the following steps to post a project-related pending vendor invoice:

1. Go to **Accounts payable** > **Invoices** and select **New**. 
2. In the **Invoice account** field, select a vendor and in the **Number** field, enter the vendor invoice identification.
3. Add a line to the vendor invoice and in the **Item number** field, select the non-stocked item purchased from the vendor. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Vendor invoice lines that are based on a procurement category can't be recorded against the project. 
    
5. Add the quantity purchased. The system will populate the unit price based on the non-stocked item price configuration. 
6. Verify the total amount and other required details on the line.
7. On the line details, on the **Project** tab, select the ID of the project that this item will be recorded to.
8. Optionally, select the activity number, and update the project category and line property.
9. Post pending vendor invoice. When the invoice is posted, the system records:
    
    - The vendor balance amount.
    - The sales tax amount.
    - The cost against the project is recorded to the procurement integration account.
    - The project actual cost transaction in Dataverse.  This transaction is further processed using the [Project Operations Integration journal](../project-accounting/project-operations-integration-journal.md). Posting this journal moves the amount from the procurement integration account to the project cost account. 
    - Purchases that will be billed to project customer using time and materials billing method will also get unbilled sales transaction created in Dataverse. System will use  Product pricelist in Dataverse for sales price/ amount for unbilled sales transaction.
