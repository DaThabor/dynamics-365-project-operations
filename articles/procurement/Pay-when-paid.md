# Pay when paid vendor payments

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

This topic provides information about how to use pay when paid scenario.

## Create a Purchase order with pay when paid terms

When you post an invoice from a vendor, if the vendor is subject to PWP terms, those terms are shown on the PO lines. To create a PO that has PWP terms, follow these steps.

1.	In Finance, go to **Procurement and sourcing** > **Purchase orders** > **All purchase orders**.
2.	On the Action Pane, select **New**. Then, in the **Create purchase order** dialog box, select the vendor for which PWP terms are setup on the project and project. Enter other required information and select **OK**.
Alternatively, Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Projects** > **All projects**, On the action pane **Manage**, **Item task**, select purchase order. Select the vendor for which PWP terms are setup on the project and select **OK**.
3.	On the **Purchase order** page, on the **Purchase order lines** Fast Tab, Click **Add line** to create a purchase order line. 
4.	Select the **Item number** or **Procurement category**, enter the other required details. Review the details of the PO line for the vendor. 
5.	The **Pay when paid** option is automatically selected, and the value in the **PWP threshold percentage** field is automatically copied from the **PWP threshold percentage** field on the **Projects** page.
6.	If you don't want to apply **PWP terms** to the vendor for a PO line, clear the **Pay when paid** option. In this case, the PWP threshold percentage field for the PO line will be reset to 0 (zero).
7.	On the Purchase order page, Click on **Action pane** Purchase and click **Confirm** to confirm the purchase order.
8.	On the Purchase order page, Click on **Action pane** Invoice and click **Invoice** to generate the invoice for the purchase order.

## Create project invoice proposal

Project invoice proposals are used to create project invoices for the customer. In pay when paid scenario, vendor payments are dependent on customer payments as per PWP settings However there are options to release the payments without customer payments if required. To create a project invoice for the customer, follow the steps below:
1.	In customer engagement, Go to **Project > Projects** and select the project.
2.	Select the **Actuals** tab. Select the actual line generated by purchase order with transaction type **Unbilled sales**. Select **Ready for invoice**.
3.	In customer engagement, Go to **Sales** > **Sales** > **Project contract**. Select the project contract. Select **Invoice** on the ribbon to raise the customer invoice.    
4.	In Finance, Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Periodic** > **Import from staging table** to generate the Project operations integration journal. Select **OK**.
5.	Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Project invoices** > **Project invoice proposal**. Select Post the invoice proposal generated for the project.

## Update a customer payment and pay the vendor
When a vendor completes its work on a project and sends you an invoice, you must review the project status and customer invoices to determine whether the PWP terms have been met for the project. If the PWP terms for the vendor were met, you can determine which lines on the vendor invoice to pay, based on the customer payments for the project. If you decide to pay the vendor even though the PWP terms weren't met, you can override the PWP terms on the Vendor invoice with pay when paid page.

1.	In Finance, Go to **Project management and accounting** > **Projects** > **All projects**. Select the project.
2.	On the action pane, Select **Control** and click **Vendor invoices**. It will display all the vendor invoices raised for the project.
3.	On the **Vendor invoices with pay when paid** page, in the search field, enter values to find the vendor invoice that you want to review, and then select **Search**.
4.	Select **Pay when paid** option to view only PWP invoices.
5.	On the **Vendor invoice lines** Fast Tab, select the lines that you want to release for payment.
6.	Select **Release vendor payment**. The **Pay when paid** option is cleared, and the value of the **Ready for payment** field is changed to **Yes**.
