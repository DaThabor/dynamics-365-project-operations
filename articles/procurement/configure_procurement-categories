# Use procurement categories with project purchase orders and pending vendor invoices

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

Purchasing professionals can create and maintain catalogs of the items and services that can be used in Project purchase orders and Pending vendor invoices.
[Procurement catalogs].(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/procurement/procurement-catalogs) provide an easy way to categorize purchases without a need to configure and use released products catalog. Each procurement category can be mapped to a project category for hour, expense or item transactions.
Once pending vendor invoice using procurement category is posted, system will create time, expense or material project actuals, project transactions and subledger entries.

## Minimum version requirement

Using procurement categories with project purchase orders for Dynamics 365 Project Operations non-stocked/resource based scenarios requires the following versions:
- Project Operations Dataverse solution â€“ 4.41.0.45 or higher
- Finance and Operations environment version - 10.0.26 or higher

## Run Dual-write maps for procurement categories support

Ensure Project Operations integration project vendor invoice line export entity msdyn_projectvendorinvoicelines	mapping is using 1.0.0.4 or higher version.

## Enable the feature key for Procurement categories

Complete the following steps to enable functionality to use procurement categories with project purchase orders.

1. In Finance, go to the **Feature Management** workspace.
2. In the feature list, find **Use procurement categories in Project Operations for resource based/non-stocked scenarios** feature and select **Enable**.
Note that as a prerequisite you must also enable feature **Enable pending vendor invoices on Project Operations for resource based/non-stocked scenarios."

## Map Project categories in Procurement category hierarchy

Use the following steps to map project categories to procurement categories in Procurement category hierarchy:
	1. Open **Procurement categories** in Procurement and sourcing module
	2. Select **Edit category hierarchy**
	3. Select desired category hierarchy node and in Assign project categories tab associate the node with the Project category from the Time, Expense or Item Project category(i.e. Default-Time or Default-Expense categories)
Save and close.

Note, that mapping procurement category to project category is optional. If category is not mapped, system will use the value set in Project Management and Accounting parameters > Project Operations on Dynamics
365 Customer engagement > Project category defaults > Item.
