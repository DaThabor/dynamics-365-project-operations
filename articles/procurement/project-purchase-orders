# Order non-stocked materials for project using Project Purchase Orders

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios_

Procurement department might use [Purchase orders](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/procurement/purchase-order-overview) to track goods and services orders. Non-stock materials Purchase Orders can be attributed to a project. Invoicing such purchase order will record the cost against the project.

> [!Important]
> Complete the following steps to enable Project Purchase Orders functionality:
>
> 1. Enable required feature key:
>   a. In Finance, go to the  **Feature Management**  workspace.
>   b. In the feature list, find  **Enable project purchase orders on Project Operations for resource based/non-stocked scenarios** feature and select  **Enable**.
> 2. Configure non-stocked materials and pending vendor invoices as described in [Configure non-stocked materials and pending vendor invoices | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/project-operations/procurement/configure-materials-nonstocked)

## Create a project purchase order from the project purchase order list

1. In Finance go to **Project management and accounting**  >  **Projects > All Projects** and select a project.
2. On the  **Action Pane** , on the  **Manage**  tab, in the  **New**  group, click  **Item task \&gt; Purchase order**.
3. In the  **Create purchase order**  form, select the vendor that you want to place the purchase order with, enter other information as appropriate, and then click  **OK**.
4. In the  **Purchase order**  form, in the  **Purchase order lines**  table, click  **Add line**.
5. Enter an item number, quantity, unit, unit price, and other information as appropriate.

> [!Note]
> Only non-stocked items and services can be used with Project purchase orders. Stocked items and Procurement categories are not supported.

1. Proceed with adding additional items as required and confirming Purchase Order.

Goods and services receipts can be recorded by creating and posting Product receipt.
