# Setup of Price lists in Project Operations

Price list in Project operations represent the concept of a catalog of rates. The rates could be expressing cost rates and sales or bill rates. Depending on whether the catalog of rates or the &quot;Price List&quot; is expressing cost rates or sales/bill rates, the Price list context is set to either &quot;Sales&quot; or &quot;Cost&quot;.

The following are Project Operations&#39; extensions to the price list from Dynamics 365 Sales application:

1. Context
  1. This is a field that has the supported values of Cost and Sales. Purchase value exists however, is not supported. Setting the context to &quot;Cost&quot; makes the price list a &quot;Cost&quot; price list and setting the context to &quot;Sales&quot; makes the price list a &quot;Sales&quot; Price list.
  2. Cost price lists are used to resolve price for cost type of estimate and actuals records.
  3. Sales price lists are used to resolve the price on Estimated and Actual records of Unbilled and Billed Sales types.
2. Time Unit
  1. Time unit is used to default the unit of time for which price is being setup in the related Role Price table for this Price List.
3. Price List Entity
  1. This is a hidden field and is used to internally by Project Operations to differentate price lists that are Quote or Contract â€“ specific from those that are standard and globally applicable.
