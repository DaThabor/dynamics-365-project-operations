### Bug fixes

**General**
- When major upgrade fails, only the main application entry points should be blocked to ensure that shared entities are still accessible.

**Time and Expense**
The following issues have been fixed:

- **TimeEntriesImportFromResourceAssignment** doesn't maintain the start and end time of the resource assignment contour slice.
- Selecting **Open Entry** on the **Time Entry** grid, may prevent you from selecting other forms.
- While importing assignments to time entries, the client code query could generate a long url that fails the query.
- In the **Time Entry** grid, after a value is deleted from a a cell, the focus doesn't remain in the grid.
- The **Reject** button has been removed from the **Processing approvals** view for modern approvals.
- Time entry bulk approval stability and performance is impacted by deadlocks and a failure to appropriately handle customizations related to the **Time Entry** entity.


**Project Planning**
- A null refernce exception is generated when you update a project with a null value in the **Contracting Unit** field.
- **Refresh Project Totals** incorrectly calculates the remaining cost and remaining sales on a project.
- Performance related to updates on resource assignment contours is impacted by redundant pricing calculations.

**Resource Management**
The following issues have been fixed:

- When a bookable resource's calendar capacity is > 1, Project Service Automation incorrectly recognizes the capacity as 0 causing an infinite loop in the schedule view.

**Sales**

The following issues have been fixed:

- When a journal line is created with a custom transaciton type, the following null reference exception occurs, *Microsoft.Dynamics.ProjectService.Plugins.JournalLinePlugins.ValidateUnitScheduleAndUnitWithTransactionType(TransactionTypetransactionType, TransactionTypeCode transTypeCodeFromPlugin)*.
- Roles and categories that are deactivated before copying a quote shouldn't be added to chargeable roles and categories of the newly copied quote.
- The document date and accounting date don't align with the start date provided on the invoice line detail for an invoice line detail created directly on a draft invoice.
- Null Reference Exceptions are generated in scenarios related to deactivating roles and categories before copying quote.
- The **Update Prices** action on the **Projects** page doesn't update expense estimates and material estimates.
