### Bug fixes

**Time and Expense**

The following issues have been fixed:

-   Users are unable to see working hours logged on non-working days in the time
    entry grid.

-   Approved expense entries are editable on the Grid.

**Project Management**

The following issues have been fixed:

-   Missing validation logic to ensure resource assignment effort hours cannot
    be negative.

-   **AssignResourcesForTask** custom action unnecessarily updates all fields
    instead of only changed fields.

-   When copying a project in an environment with plugins or workflows
    registered on the **CreateProject** event, attribute
    **msdyn_bulkgenerationstatus** is not updated when the **CopyWBSToProject**
    fails.

-   When expanding the project calendar, the working days are not being sorted
    in ascending order, causing failures in some updates to project tasks.

-   Changing the Project Manager on an existing project triggers the
    organizational unit defaulting logic.

**Sales**

The following issues have been fixed:

- Contract Performance tab on the contract form fails silently during
initialization when no contract lines are present.
