# Upgrade from Project Service Automation to Project Operations

We are excited to announce the first of three phases for upgrade from Microsoft Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation to Dynamics 365 Project Operations. This topic provides an overview for customers who are embarking on this exciting journey. Future topics will include developer considerations and details about feature enhancements. They will not only provide guidance to help you prepare for your upgrade to Project Operations but also explain what you can expect after you've upgraded.

The upgrade delivery program will be split into the three phases.

| Upgrade delivery | Phase 1 (January 2022) | Phase 2 (April Wave 2022) | Phase 3 (April Wave 2022) |
|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| No dependency on the work breakdown structure (WBS) for projects | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| The WBS within the currently supported limits of Project Operations | | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| The WBS outside the currently supported limits of Project Operations, including support for the Project desktop client | | | :heavy_check_mark: |

## Upgrade process features 

As part of the upgrade process, we have added upgrade logs to the site map, so that administrators can more easily diagnose failures. In addition to the new interface, new validation rules will be added to ensure data integrity after an upgrade. The following validations will be added to the upgrade process.

| Validations | Phase 1 (January 2022) | Phase 2 (April Wave 2022) | Phase 3 (April Wave 2022) |
|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| The WBS will be validated against common data integrity violations (for example, resource assignments that are associated with the same parent task but have different parent projects). | | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| The WBS will be validated against the [known limits of Project for the Web](/project-for-the-web/project-for-the-web-limits-and-boundaries). | | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| The WBS will be validated against the known limits of the Project desktop client. | |  | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Bookable resources and project calendars will be evaluated against common incompatible calendar rule exceptions. | | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |

In phase 2, customers who upgrade to Project Operations will have their existing projects upgraded to a read-only experience for project planning. In this read-only experience, the full WBS will be visible in the tracking grid. To edit the WBS, project managers can select **Convert** on the main **Projects** page. A background process will then update the project so that it supports the new project scheduling experience from Project for the Web. This phase is appropriate for customers who have projects that fit within the [known limits of Project for the Web](/project-for-the-web/project-for-the-web-limits-and-boundaries).

In phase 3, support for the Project desktop client will be added, for the benefit of customers who want to continue to edit their projects from that application. However, if existing projects are converted to the new Project for the Web experience, access to the add-in will be disabled for each converted project.

## Prerequisites

To be eligible for the phase 1 upgrade, a customer must meet the following criteria:

- The target environment must not contain any records in the **msdyn_projecttask** entity.
- Valid Project Operations licenses must be assigned to all the customer's active users. 
- The customer must validate the upgrade process in at least one non-production environment that has a representative dataset that is aligned with production data.
- The target environment must be updated to Project Service Automation Update Release 38 (3.10.59.117) or later.

Prerequisites for phase 2 and phase 3 will be updated as the general availability dates approach.

## Licensing

If you have active licenses for Project Service Automation, you can install and use Project Operations, which includes all the capabilities of Project Service Automation and more. In this way, you can test the capabilities of Project Operations while you continue to use Project Service Automation in production. After your Project Service Automation licenses expire, you will have to transition to Project Operations. When you plan this transition, you must account for the fact that the Project Operations license doesn't include a Project Service Automation license.

## Testing and refactoring customizations

As a starting point, import all customizations into a clean Project Operations (lite) environment to confirm that import is successful, and that business operations behave as expected.

Here are some things to watch out for:

- Import might fail because of missing dependencies. In other words, the customizations reference fields or other components that have been removed in Project Operations. In this case, remove these dependencies from the development environment.
- If your unmanaged and managed solutions include components that aren't customized, remove those components from the solution. For example, when you customize the **Project** entity, add only the entity header to your solution. Don't add all the fields. If you've previously added all subcomponents, you might have to manually create a new solution and add relevant components to it.
- Forms and views might not appear as unexpected. Under some circumstances, if you've customized any of the out-of-box forms or views, the customizations might prevent new updates in Project Operations from taking effect. To identify these issues, we recommend that you do a side-by-side review of a clean installation of Project Operations and an installation of Project Operations that includes your customizations. Compare the most commonly used forms in your business to confirm that your version of the form still makes sense and isn't missing something from the clean version of the form. Do the same type of side-by-side review for any views that you've customized.
- Business logic might fail at runtime. Because references to fields in your plug-ins aren't validated at the time of import, business logic might fail because of references to fields that no longer exist, and you might receive an error message that resembles the following example: "'Project' entity doesn't contain attribute with Name = 'msdyn_plannedhours' and NameMapping = 'Logical'." In this case, modify your customizations so that they use the new fields. If you use automatically generated proxy classes and strong type references in your plug-in logic, consider regenerating those proxies from a clean installation. In this way, you can easily identify all the places where your plug-ins depend on deprecated fields.

After you update your customizations to cleanly import Project Operations, move on to the next steps.

## End-to-end testing in development environments

### Initiate upgrade 

1. In the Power Platform admin center, find and select your environment. Then, in the applications, find and select **Dynamics 365 Project Operations**.
2. Select **Install** to start the upgrade. The Power Platform admin center will present this installation as a new installation. However, the presence of an earlier version of Project Service Automation will be detected, and the existing installation will be upgraded.

    After the upgrade is completed, the environment should show that Project Operations is installed, and that Project Service Automation isn't installed.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Depending on the amount of data in the environment, the upgrade might take several hours. The core team that is managing the upgrade should plan accordingly and run the upgrade during non-business hours. In some cases, if the data volume is large, the upgrade should be run during the weekend. The decision about scheduling should be based on the testing results in lower environments.

3. Upgrade custom solutions as appropriate. At this point, deploy any changes that you made to your customizations in the [Testing and refactoring customizations](#testing-and-refactoring-customizations) section of this topic.
4. Go to **Settings** \> **Solutions**, and select to uninstall the **Project Operations Deprecated Components** solution.

    This solution is a temporary solution that holds the existing data model and components that are present during the upgrade. By removing this solution, you remove all the fields and components that are no longer used. In this way, you help simplify the interface and make integration and extension easier.
    
### Validate common scenarios

When you validate your specific customizations, we recommend that you also review the business processes that are supported across the applications. These business processes include, but aren't limited to, the creation of sales entities such as quotations and contracts, and the creation of projects that include WBSs and approval of actuals.

## Major changes between Project Service Automation and Project Operations

This section provides a summary of the major changes that you can expect between Project Service Automation and Project Operations.

### Project planning

The project planning capabilities in Project Operations no longer rely on a combination client-side logic and server-side logic. Instead, Project Operations uses Project for the Web as its scheduling engine. This change in scheduling capabilities enables several new features, such as Board and Gantt views, resource-driven planning, [task checklist items](https://support.microsoft.com/office/use-task-checklists-in-microsoft-project-for-the-web-c69bcf73-5c75-4ad3-9893-6d6f92360e9c), and project scheduling modes. The new scheduling capabilities are also supported by a rich set of new [application programming interfaces (APIs)](../project-management/schedule-api-preview.md). These APIs are intended to help ensure that no programmatic operation for creating, updating, or deleting an entity in the WBS corrupts the calculated fields in the schedule.

## Billing and pricing

As part of continuing investments in Project Operations, several new capabilities are available in Billing and pricing. Here are some examples:

- [Recording material usage on projects and project tasks](../material/material-usage-log.md)
- [Subcontract management](../pro/subcontracting/managing-subcontracts-overview.md)
- [Advances and retainer-based contracts](../pro/sales/set-up-advances-retainer-based-contracts-sales.md)
- [Contract not-to-exceed status and validations](../pro/proforma-invoicing/manage-nte-status-validations-sales.md)
- Task-based billing

### How can I install Project Operations before the upgrade tooling is available?

There are two options for installing Project Operations before the upgrade tooling is available:

- Provision a new environment.
- Deploy Project Operations separately on any sales organization where Project Service Automation isn't present.

> [!NOTE]
> If Project Service Automation is installed on an organization, but it wasn't used, it can be uninstalled. After you completely remove Project Service Automation, Project Operations can be installed on the same organization.
