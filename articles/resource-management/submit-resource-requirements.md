# Submit a resource request

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

You can submit a generated resource requirement as a resource request. The request is then sent to a resource manager for fulfillment.

1. In Dynamics 365 Project Operations, on the **Projects** page, select the **Team** tab to view a list of bookable resources. 
2. Select the generic resource that has a resource requirement from the list, and then click **Submit Request**.

The request status of the generic team member will change to **Submitted**.

After the request is fulfilled, the generic resource is replaced by a named resource if the resource manager fulfills the request by booking a named resource. Otherwise, if the resource manager proposes a named resource, the generic resource remains on the team and the request status will change to **Needs Review**.
