# Submit a resource request

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

You can submit a generated resource requirement as a resource request. The request is then sent to a resource manager for fulfillment.

1. In Dynamics 365 Project Operations, on the **Projects** page, select the **Team** tab to view a list of bookable resources. 
2. Select the generic resource that has a resource requirement from the list, and then click **Submit Request**.

The request status of the generic team member will change to **Submitted**.

The recipient of the resource request has the ability to either partially fullfill the request with one or more resources or alternatively completely fulfill the resource request.

After the request is completely fulfilled, one or many named resources will be added to the project as project team members.  If the resource requirement is fulfillled by a single resource, the generic team member associated with the resource request will be deleted. 

Once the recipient of the Resource Request has proposed the resource and are ready for the Project Manager to review who has been proposed, they should update the status of the resource request to **Needs Review**.
