Defining resource calendars
===========================

Each bookable resource to be engaged in project delivery must have a calendar of working hours to define their availability. Workings hours for a resource can be defined in two ways: 

- By defining individual calendar rules for a resource
- By applying an existing calendar template to the resource.

Defining the working hours of a resource
----------------------------------------

1.  Navigate to the **Resources** menu and select **Resources**.

2.  From the grid view, select the applicable **Bookable Resource**.

3.  Within the **Resource Details** page, navigate to the **Working Hours** tab.

4.  By default, the bookable resources calendar will default to the working
    hours of the default work hour template defined for the organization.

5.  To update the working hours, right-click on the start date of the proposed
    calendar rule to be defined.

6.  The calendar rule menu will allow the user to define a calendar rule for a
    specific day, the remainder of the series, or the entire calendar.

7.  Once an option has been selected, the user can then define:

    1.  The day of the week where the working hours will apply.

    2.  The working times within each day.

    3.  The time zone for the calendar rule.

    4.  If applicable, non-working time can also be specified for the rule.

Applying a calendar template to a resource
------------------------------------------

1.  Navigate to the **Resources** menu and select **Resources**.

2.  From the grid view, select up to 25 **Bookable Resources** to update.

3.  Select **Set Calendar** and a dialog will prompt you with a list of
    available work hour templates.

4.  Select the desired template and hit **Apply**.
