# Bookings vs assignments

Bookings are the hard or soft allocation of resources to a project. Hard bookings consume a resource's capacity. Assignments are the assignment of resources to project tasks in the project schedule. The resources can be either real or generic resources. Ideally, for real resources, the bookings and assignments should agree, because they don't differ. However, Microsoft Dynamics Project operations doesn't enforce this agreement. The **Reconciliation** view shows a project manager places where a resource's bookings and assignments don't agree.
