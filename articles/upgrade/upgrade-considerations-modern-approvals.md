# Upgrade considerations for Modern Approvals 

_**Applies To:** Project Operations for resource/non-stocked based scenarios, Lite deployment - deal to proforma invoicing_

As part of the April 2022 Wave 1 Release, the Modern Approvals functionality will be enabled by default. This functionality improves the reliability of the approval logic and ensures that you can determine the reason if the approval logic fails.

As part of this change, status changes for project approvals are updated. The status now goes directly from **Submitted** to **Approved**. **Pending** is no longer a status for approvals. To determine whether an approval is pending, verify that the approval is part of an approval set, and the review the state of the attached approval set.

## Before you upgrade

Before you upgrade to Modern Approvals, make sure that you have no pending approvals. Modern Approvals doesn't use the **Pending** status. Therefore, any approvals that are still marked as **Pending** after upgrade won't be processed.

## After you upgrade

After you upgrade to Modern Approvals, an administrator must validate that the cloud flow that processes approvals has been enabled.

1. Sign in to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com)
2. In the upper right of the page, switch your environment to the environment that you've upgraded.
3. Select **Solutions** to list the solutions that are installed in the environment.
4. In the solution list, select **Project Operations** or **Project Service**.
5. Change the filter from **All** to **Cloud Flows**.
6. Verify that the **Project Service â€“ Recurrently Schedule Project Approval Sets** option is set to **On**. If it isn't, select the flow, and then select **Turn on**.
7. Verify that processing is occurring every five minutes by reviewing the **System Jobs** list in the **Settings** area.

## Short-term rollback

If you can't uptake the changes, or if you encounter a severe issue with this feature, you can temporarily revert to the original approval flow by performing the following steps:
1. Sign-in to your environment and ensure that they are no pending approvals.
2. Open the **Project Parameters** from the **Settings** area.
3. Select **Feature Control**.
4. Select **Modern Approvals** to disable the feature.

## Removing the feature flag

In the October 2022 Wave 2 update, the ability to turn this feature off will be removed.
